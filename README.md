Attendance Management System Using Face Detection
Overview
The Attendance Management System is an advanced, automated solution that leverages deep learning to detect and recognize faces for attendance marking. This system eliminates the need for traditional attendance-taking methods, offering a seamless and secure way to track attendance in real-time or from images and videos.

Features
Face Detection: Identifies faces using deep learning models.
Face Recognition: Matches detected faces against a database of registered users.
Automated Attendance: Logs attendance without manual intervention.
Fine-Tuned Model: Enhanced accuracy through model customization with domain-specific datasets.
Real-Time Processing: Processes live camera feeds or pre-recorded media.
